			<p><a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=19856">Registration is a statutory requirement that applies to all aircraft.</a> Under this rule, any owner of a small UAS who has previously operated an unmanned aircraft exclusively as a model aircraft prior to December 21, 2015, must register no later than February 19, 2016. Owners of any other UAS purchased for use as a model aircraft after December 21, 2015 must register before the first flight outdoors. Owners may use either the paper-based process or the new streamlined, web-based system.  Owners using the new streamlined web-based system must be at least 13 years old to register. Owners may register through a web-based system at <a href="www.faa.gov/uas/registration">www.faa.gov/uas/registration.</a>
