##Installing new libraries/packages

To install node packages use npm. An example of an installation would be "npm install <package_name_here> -save". If it doesn't work use prefix the command with sudo. The "-save" is so the package name and version is recorded in the package.json file.

Npm can be installed by installing node here: https://nodejs.org/en/

##Installing and updating current packages

Run "npm install" or "sudo npm install". This will install all of the packages

##Running server

Use the "node app" command in this directory to run the server on localhost.
